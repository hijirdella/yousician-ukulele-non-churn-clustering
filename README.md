# yousician-ukulele-non-churn-clustering
KMeans clustering analysis for non churned users in the "Ukulele by Yousician" dataset. This project explores behavior patterns of users who have disengaged from the app using TF-IDF vectorization of review text and clustering of usage metrics. Visualizations include PCA, heatmaps, and segment profiles to support  non churn intervention strategies.<br>
